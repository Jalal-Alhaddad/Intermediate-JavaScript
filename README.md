# Intermediate JavaScript

## First Stage: Foundations of JavaScript

### 1. Objects and Classes

#### Old Way

- Introduction to creating objects using functions and prototypes.
- Example of defining methods using prototype chaining.

#### ES6 Class Syntax

- Introduce the class keyword and how it simplifies the old function/prototype approach.
- Example: creating constructors and methods within a class.
- Comparison between the old and new methods.

> Key Learning Points
>
> - Differences between function constructors and ES6 classes.
> - Simplification with ES6 syntax.

### 2. Different Forms of Functions

- **Function Declaration**: Standard way of declaring a function.
- **Function Expression**: Assigning a function to a variable.
- **Arrow Functions**: Introduction to the concise syntax of arrow functions.
- **Function Differences**:
  - `this` context: Introduce the concept of this in regular functions versus arrow functions.
  - How `this` behaves in different functions (context of a method inside a class or object).

> Key Learning Points
>
> - Understand the purpose of this in function contexts.
> - How arrow functions differ, especially in terms of this.

### 3. Arrays and Important Methods

- Basic array operations like push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift().
- Key methods to cover:
  - `map()`: Transformation of arrays.
  - `filter()`: Filtering array elements based on conditions.
  - `reduce()`: Combining array elements into a single value.
  - `forEach()`: Iterating over arrays.
  - `find()` and `findIndex()`: Finding elements in arrays.

#### Key Learning Points (3)

- Manipulating arrays with built-in methods.
- Applying transformation and filtering logic to arrays.

### 4. Destructuring (Object and Array)

- **Object Destructuring**:
  - Unpacking properties from objects into variables.
- **Array Destructuring**:
  - Unpacking elements from arrays into variables.

> Key Learning Points
>
> - Simplify access to object and array data using destructuring.
> - Understand how destructuring is helpful in functional programming.

### 5. Spread Operator and Rest Parameters

- Spread Operator:
  - How to use `...` to expand arrays and objects.
  - Use cases: merging arrays, shallow copying objects.
- Rest Parameters:
  - Using `...` to gather remaining arguments into an array.

> Key Learning Points (5)
>
> - Applying spread for array and object expansion and copying.
> - How rest parameters allow handling variable numbers of function arguments.

### 6. Modules

- Introduce export and import.
- Explain the role of modules in organizing code and separating functionality.
- Examples of exporting and importing functions, objects, and classes between files.

> Key Learning Points (6)
>
> - How modules improve code reusability and maintainability.
> - Understanding of named and default exports.
